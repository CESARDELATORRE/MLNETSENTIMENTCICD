Mediocre food.	0
Once you get inside you'll be impressed with the place.	1
I'm super pissd.	0
Food quality has been horrible.	0
And service was super friendly.	1
Why are these sad little vegetables so overcooked?	0
This place was such a nice surprise!	1
They were golden-crispy and delicious.	1
"I had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill, but unfortunately the taste fell flat, way flat."	0
I could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine.	1
Not a single employee came out to see if we were OK or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food.	0
"Lastly, the mozzarella sticks, they were the best thing we ordered."	1
"The first time I ever came here I had an amazing experience, I still tell people how awesome the duck was."	1
The server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome... I would not suggest this place!	0
The service was terrible though.	0
"This place is overpriced, not consistent with their boba, and it really is OVERPRICED!"	0
It was packed!!	0
I love this place.	1
I can say that the desserts were yummy.	1
The food was terrible.	0
The seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree.	1
It kept getting worse and worse so now I'm officially done.	0
This place should honestly be blown up.	0
But I definitely would not eat here again.	0
Do not waste your money here!	0
I love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes.	1
The crêpe was delicate and thin and moist.	1
Awful service.	0
Won't ever go here again.	0
Food quality has been horrible.	0
For that price I can think of a few place I would have much rather gone.	0
The service here is fair at best.	0
"I do love sushi, but I found Kabuki to be over-priced, over-hip and under-services."	0
Do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish.	0
Very poor service.	0
No one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it.	0
"Best service and food ever, Maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day."	1
They were excellent.	1
I paid the bill but did not tip because I felt the server did a terrible job.	0
Just had lunch here and had a great experience.	1
I have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor.	0
Food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small.	0
I recently tried Caballero's and I have been back every week since!	1
"for 40 bucks a head, i really expect better food."	0
The food came out at a good pace.	1
"I ate there twice on my last visit, and especially enjoyed the salmon salad."	1
I won't be back.	0
We could not believe how dirty the oysters were!	0
This place deserves no stars.	0
I would not recommend this place.	0
"In fact I'm going to round up to 4 stars, just because she was so awesome."	1
"To my disbelief, each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods I have ever tasted."	0
"Bad day or not, I have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people, it is your job to be nice and polite, wash dishes otherwise!!"	0
the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit.	1
I probably would not go here again.	0
So flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat.	1
The price is reasonable and the service is great.	1
"The Wife hated her meal (coconut shrimp), and our friends really did not enjoy their meals, either."	0
My fella got the huevos rancheros and they didn't look too appealing.	0
"Went in for happy hour, great list of wines."	1
Some may say this buffet is pricey but I think you get what you pay for and this place you are getting quite a lot!	1
I probably won't be coming back here.	0
Worst food/service I've had in a while.	0
"This place is pretty good, nice little vibe in the restaurant."	1
Talk about great customer service of course we will be back.	1
"Hot dishes are not hot, cold dishes are close to room temp.I watched staff prepare food with BARE HANDS, no gloves.Everything is deep fried in oil."	0
I love their fries and their beans.	1
Always a pleasure dealing with him.	1
"They have a plethora of salads and sandwiches, and everything I've tried gets my seal of approval."	1
This place is awesome if you want something light and healthy during the summer.	1
"For sushi on the Strip, this is the place to go."	1
"The service was great, even the manager came and helped with our table."	1
The feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best.	0
"I started this review with two stars, but I'm editing it to give it only one."	0
this is the worst sushi i have ever eat besides Costco's.	0
"All in all an excellent restaurant highlighted by great service, a unique menu, and a beautiful setting."	1
My boyfriend and i sat at the bar and had a completely delightful experience.	1
Weird vibe from owners.	0
There was hardly any meat.	0
I've had better bagels from the grocery store.	0
I consider this theft.	0
"I love the owner/chef, his one authentic Japanese cool dude!"	1
"Now the burgers aren't as good, the pizza which used to be amazing is doughy and flavorless."	0
I found a six inch long piece of wire in my salsa.	0
"The service was terrible, food was mediocre."	0
We definately enjoyed ourselves.	1
I ordered Albondigas soup - which was just warm - and tasted like tomato soup with frozen meatballs.	0
"On three different occasions I asked for well done or medium well, and all three times I got the bloodiest piece of meat on my plate."	0
I had about two bites and refused to eat anymore.	0
The service was extremely slow.	0
"After 20 minutes wait, I got a table."	0
Seriously killer hot chai latte.	1
"No allergy warnings on the menu, and the waitress had absolutely no clue as to which meals did or did not contain peanuts."	0
My boyfriend tried the Mediterranean Chicken Salad and fell in love.	1
Their rotating beers on tap is also a highlight of this place.	1
Pricing is a bit of a concern at Mellow Mushroom.	0
